# Identifying-Optimal-Light-Wavelength-on-the-Plant-Growth-for-Indoor-Vertical-Farm
This research aims to optimize light wavelength for plant growth in vertical farms, a crucial factor due to the substantial energy and associated costs required for artificial LED lighting. Traditional vertical farming practices face challenges with high electricity expenses, limiting their widespread adoption. Our study addresses this by employing advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms and image analysis techniques to predict the most effective light wavelength in the Electromagnetic spectrum for enhancing plant growth rates. Previously, the optimal growth rate was gauged using an R-CNN network model based on leaf area measurements over time, yielding average accuracy. We have extended this approach by comparing the efficacy of Multiple Linear Regression and deep learning neural network models, particularly the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), in a controlled vertical farm environment. Our comparative analysis focuses on the accuracy of these models in predicting plant growth areas with minimal loss. In our experimental setup, four trays were equipped with cameras and lighting systems, and real-time datasets were analyzed. The ANN model demonstrated superior performance over traditional ML models. Additionally, we explored the relative contributions of environmental factors like soil quality, moisture, humidity, nutrients, and carbon dioxide and oxygen consumption. These factors are critical features in our predictive models, further enhancing their accuracy and practical applicability in optimizing lighting for indoor vertical farms.
